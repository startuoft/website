        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <br>START is a team of University of Toronto students participating in the 2024/2025 Canadian Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Design Challenge.<br>
        <br> This competition allows university students to design and test a small scientific experiment on a high-altitude balloon provided by the Canadian Space Agency. <br>
        <br>START also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to expand their professional network and develop technical skills which build strong and confident future engineers, scientists and researchers.<br>

        <h2>This Year’s Mission</h2>
        <img src="https://github.com/startuoft/website/issues/1#issue-2918055341" alt="Uploaded Image" width="300">
        <br>As NASA’s Gateway project works to return humanity to the moon and new engineering solutions are crucial for success. Without Earth’s atmosphere to protect astronauts, space radiation becomes a major threat to their health and future space exploration.<br>
        <br>Fortunately, the stratospheric environment serves as an ideal Earth-based analog to space radiation. Our design aims to expose human cells to this radiation while keeping them alive, offering a unique opportunity for research on the impact that Galactic Cosmic Rays have on human DNA. <br>
    </div>
    
    <div id="payload" class="menu-content">
        <h2>Our Payload</h2>
        <br>This payload is designed to support research on the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) by exposing human cell cultures to the stratospheric environment. <br>
        <br> The payload consists of multiple subsystems that ensure the biological samples remain within controlled conditions throughout the flight. These include a temperature-controlled chamber, a pressurized containment system, and a robust structural enclosure to protect against external environmental factors. <br> 
    </div>
    
    <div id="outreach" class="menu-content">
        <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
        <br> We had the privilege to host a four hour workshop during the National Society of Black Engineers’ Annual High School Conference.<br> 
        <br> We gave a thirty minute lecture on galactic cosmic rays, the stratospheric environment and relevant material properties.<br>
